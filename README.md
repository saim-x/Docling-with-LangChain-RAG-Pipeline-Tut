# Docling-with-LangChain-RAG-Pipeline-Tut

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Docling and LangChain in a Google Colab environment. It demonstrates how to process PDF documents, split them into chunks, and utilize LangChain components for a RAG workflow. Hugging Face is used for large language model interaction, and Milvus serves as the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
